        <p>In medicine, the stakes are often high.</p>
        <p>Patients will place their lives in the hands of doctors (sometimes literally) in hopes of finding relief from suffering.</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, this requires a huge amount of trust. But what happens when this foundation is threatened?</p>
        <p>What happens when information (and advice) are commoditised? What happens when systems can be hacked faster than we can protect them? What happens when technology blurs the line between physical and virtual?</p>
        <p>Without a common consensus, there is no trust. And without trust, our societies fall apart.</p>
        <p>Blockchain promises to protect us from this collapse.</p>
        <p>It claims to restore an undeniable groundtruth, not with force or politics, but with mathematics.</p>
        <p>In the past, I’ve associated the word “blockchain” with cryptocurrency trading scams and delusional NFT collectors. This wasn’t entirely wrong, but there’s more to it than that.</p>
        <p>And at the heart of this “more”, we find the idea of decentralisation.</p>
