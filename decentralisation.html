        <p>Humans can't survive without a brain.</p>
        <p>Without the right neural inputs, vital processes fail, and take the rest of the body with them.</p>
        <p>But what if we were designed differently?</p>
        <p>What if, instead of a single brain, we each had millions (or even billions) of tiny brains, dispersed all throughout the world?</p>
        <p>One thing's for sure: we'd be much harder to kill.</p>
        <p>This is the idea behind decentralisation. Our million-brain analogy is imperfect, but it makes a lot more sense when you replace "brains" with "computers".</p>
        <p>A decentralised system has no single source of control. Instead, decisions are distributed across all nodes in the network.</p>
        <p>Blockchains are one such system.</p>
        <p>They're public, immutable, decentralised ledgers of information, kept alive by the cumulative inputs of each participant.</p>
        <p>The idea is to create a central source of truth that <i>isn't owned by any single person</i>. A global, unfakeable ground truth.</p>
        <p>Let's take a closer look at how this works.</p>
